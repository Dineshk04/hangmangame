<h1 align="center"> HangMan Game</h1>

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

Hangman is an old school favorite, a word game where the goal is simply to find the missing word or words.
You will be presented with a number of blank spaces representing the missing letters you need to find.
Use the keyboard to guess a letter (I recommend starting with vowels).
If your chosen letter exists in the answer, then all places in the answer where that letter appear will be revealed.
After you've revealed several letters, you may be able to guess what the answer is and fill in the remaining letters.
Be warned, every time you guess a letter wrong you loose a life and the hangman begins to appear, piece by piece.
Solve the puzzle before the hangman dies.

HOW TO RUN:

1) Download the hangman folder.
2) open visual studio code (or your prefered editor).
3) run main.py

INSTRUCTIONS:

2)The valid letters are 'a-z' , 'A-Z' , ' (space)' , '-'.

3)The meaning of the word is given in the starting of the game.

4)you get 10 chances to find the correct letter present in the word and each correct word is filled in the missing blank.

5)If every blank is filled before 10 chances you win else you loose the game.
